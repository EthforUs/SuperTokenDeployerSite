# SuperToken Deployer

The SuperTokenDeployer is a user friendly website which can be used to create custom super tokens and deploy them without having to write contracts.

## The problem SuperToken Deployer solves
- The Users who don't know how to create smartcontracts and deploy it are not able to create their own supertokens. 
- They become dependant to other developers.
- Through Our framework any user can create their own custom supertoken in any network at no time.
